Throughout this course we’ll link a lot of different websites and resources to check out. This way, no matter how you learn, you’ll always have resources for digging deeper on a specific subject.

Below we have compiled a list of some of our favorites.

## Resources:
* **People**

* **Books**
  * [Kubernetes: Up and Running, Kelsey Hightower](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043874.do) The definitive book on Kubernetes. This has been a great resource while making this course.
  * [Building Microservices: Defining Fine-Grained Systems](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do) This is the book Kelsey reads before giving talks about microservices. It’s that good.

* **Articles**
  * Martin Fowler on the [Pros](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) and [Cons](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html) of Microservices
  * [12-Fractured Apps](https://medium.com/@kelseyhightower/12-fractured-apps-1080c73d481c) - One of Carters favorites articles where Kelsey breaks down problems with many modern apps and how 12-factor app methodology solves those technical woes, Find out more about the 12-factor manifesto here: http://12factor.net/
  * Tim O’Reilly, ["Open Data: Small Pieces Loosely Joined"](http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/09/open-data-small-pieces-loosely.html) For the history nerds: Quite possibly the first article about Microservices Architecture (before it even had a name).

* **Videos**
  * Adrian Cockroft ["The Evolution of Microservices"](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86151804)
  * Adrian Cockroft ["The State of the Art in Microservices"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpxq9-uw_0) (docker specific)

  * Craig McLuckie ["The Next Chapter in Native Cloud Computing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPhjFYXoAD0) on cloud-native computing as being: container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled, and microservices-oriented
  
## Tools we use in the course
* **The Go Programming Language**
  * Our app is written in Go. If you’re not already using Go, you owe it to yourself to try it out.
  * https://golang.org/

* **Google Cloud Shell**
  * A free temp VM preloaded with the tools need to manage our clusters.
  * https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/
  
* **Docker**
  * We use Docker to package, distribute, and run our application.
  * https://www.docker.com/
  
* **Kubernetes**
  * Once we have an application, we use Kubernetes to handle the heavy lifting of managing, deploying, and scaling our application.
  * http://kubernetes.io/
  
* **Google Container Engine (GKE)**
  * GKE is a hosted Kubernetes service
  * https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/
